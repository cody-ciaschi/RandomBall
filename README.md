# Ball Exercise Code
This is a small project I worked on to have balls of different colors bounce across a screen. Every time a ball hits the edge of the screen in will change to a random color.

## Usage
To use this code:
1. Clone the Repo
2. Drag and drop the .html file into your browser
3. Open developer tools and type `main()` in the console
4. Enjoy!
